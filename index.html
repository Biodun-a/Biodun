                    <h1> Why I Joined AltSchool Africa</h1>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Attraction to Practical Learning:</h2>
                        <p>I chose to join AltSchool Africa because of its commitment to practical, hands-on learning.
                            Unlike traditional academic programs, AltSchool emphasizes real-world applications of
                            technology, ensuring that students are not only learning theoretical concepts but also
                            applying them in meaningful ways. This approach is particularly appealing to me because I
                            believe that true understanding comes from doing, and I wanted to be part of a program that
                            prioritizes this method of education.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>
                            Focus on Industry-Relevant Skills:</h2>
                        <p>Another reason for my decision was AltSchool's focus on preparing students for the demands of
                            the tech industry. The curriculum is designed to equip students with the skills that
                            employers are actively seeking, such as software development, problem-solving, and
                            collaboration. Knowing that I would graduate with a skill set that is directly applicable to
                            the workforce gave me confidence that this program would set me on the right path toward
                            achieving my career goals.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Community and Mentorship:</h2>
                        <p>The opportunity to be part of a vibrant community of learners and professionals was also a
                            significant factor. AltSchool’s emphasis on mentorship and collaboration means that I will
                            have the chance to learn from industry experts and network with peers who share my passion
                            for technology. This collaborative environment is essential for my growth, as it provides a
                            support system and valuable insights that will guide me throughout my learning journey.</p>

                    <h1> Goals For Joining School of Engineering Program </h1>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Deepening Technical Knowledge:</h2>
                        <p>One of my primary goals in the School of Engineering program is to deepen my understanding of
                            software development. I
                            aim to master the fundamental concepts of programming, algorithms, and system design, which
                            are critical to building
                            robust and efficient software solutions. By engaging with the curriculum and tackling
                            complex projects, I hope to gain a
                            comprehensive understanding of these areas, laying a solid foundation for my future career.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Enhancing Problem-Solving Skills:</h2>
                        <p>Another key objective is to improve my problem-solving abilities. The tech industry is
                            constantly evolving, and
                            engineers are often faced with challenges that require innovative and creative solutions.
                            Through the program, I want to
                            sharpen my analytical thinking and develop strategies for tackling difficult problems. This
                            will not only make me a
                            better engineer but also prepare me for leadership roles where decision-making and
                            problem-solving are crucial.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>
                            Gaining Practical Experience:</h2>
                        <p>I also intend to gain as much practical experience as possible. AltSchool’s project-based
                            approach allows students to
                            work on real-world challenges, providing an invaluable opportunity to apply theoretical
                            knowledge in practical settings.
                            My goal is to participate in a variety of projects that will give me hands-on experience,
                            enabling me to build a strong
                            portfolio that demonstrates my skills and versatility to potential employers.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>
                            Networking and Community Building:</h2>
                        <p>Finally, I aspire to build strong relationships within the AltSchool community. Networking
                            with peers, mentors, and
                            industry professionals is essential for personal and professional growth. I plan to actively
                            engage in the community,
                            contribute to discussions, and collaborate on projects, all of which will help me to learn
                            from others and share my own
                            insights. This network will be instrumental in my career development, providing
                            opportunities for mentorship,
                            collaboration, and lifelong learning.</p>
